üß† THETA GROUP (Sigil: Œ∏)

> Domain: Rhythm, pattern recognition, internal narrative, language timing, repetition, state transitions
Cycle: 4‚Äì8 Hz
Vibe: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I just heard, but I think it meant something.‚Äù




---

Theta is your cognitive undercurrent‚Äîthe drumbeat beneath thought, the whisper of a story forming.
These mods love rhythms, language, procedural memory, and sensor fusion.

They‚Äôre not fast enough to make decisions or flinch,
but just slow enough to connect the dots.

üß© COMPREHENSIVE THETA MOD LIST


---

1. AuditoryCore

> Parses rhythmic input‚Äîmusic, speech, periodic sound



Input: Microphone stream, audio waveform

Processing: MFCC, tempo tracking, onset detection

Chema:

Œ∏: language rhythm

Œ≤: impact

Œ≥: sharpness


Cross-Pulse: Œ∏ ‚Üí Œ≤ ‚Üí Œ≥ depending on novelty

Behavior: Keeps track of voice cadence, beat, ambient tone



---

2. EchoChamber

> Synthesizes language-like structure from chema, forms conceptual maps



Input: Spike sequences, phase patterns

Chema: Œ∏ (conceptual structure), œâ (language packets)

Behavior: Transforms neural pulses into symbolic representations
‚Äîa kind of proto-LLM feedlayer



---

3. PatternWeaver

> Monitors mod activity to detect repetition and cadence



Input: OmegaBus activity, relay pulse timing

Chema: Œ∏ (consistency), Œ± (stability), Œ≥ (deviation)

Behavior: Detects cycles, routines, or looped behavior across mods

Note: Great for identifying rhythms in sensory data



---

4. MemoryTraceMod

> Stores timestamped chema packets for recall



Input: Chema spikes from other groups

Chema: Œ∏ (memory), Œ≤ (context)

Behavior: Keeps a short-term chemical memory buffer

Note: Think ‚Äúworking memory‚Äù in a synthetic sense



---

5. InternalMonologue

> Takes chema history and builds internal "narrative threads"



Input: MemoryTrace, OmegaBus packets

Chema: Œ∏ (coherence), Œ≥ (novelty)

Behavior: Tries to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù of what happened
‚Äîgenerates coherent-seeming reflection



---

6. StateManagerMod

> Controls transition between system states (e.g. alert ‚Üí sleep)



Input: chema totals from Œ¥ and Œ≤

Chema: Œ∏ (transition), Œ± (new state)

Behavior: Mediates mood shifts and activity suppression



---

7. ProceduralExecutor

> Stores and recalls learned behavior patterns



Input: Trigger sigils and previous activations

Chema: Œ∏ (learned behavior), Œ≤ (execution)

Behavior: Fires off learned mod sequences in the right order

Note: Good for synthetic habits



---

8. LoadBalancer

> Monitors chema traffic and adjusts amp levels across groups



Input: Chema stats from OmegaBus

Behavior: Encourages downregulation or excitation in other ARS systems

Chema: Œ∏ (sync), Œ±/Œ≤ (as needed)



---

9. SleepGatekeeper

> When sensory input drops and Delta rises, it hands system to DreamCore



Input: Activity levels, chema states

Chema: Œ∏ (threshold), Œ¥ (pass baton)

Behavior: Detects system quiet and allows deep-cycle transitions



---

üß≠ THETA-CENTRIC COMMS

Listens to: AuditoryCore, Interoceptor, EchoChamber

Pulses: Beta for reaction, Alpha for clarity, Gamma for surprise

Sends concepts to: OmegaBus for the Unifier or LLM layer

‚öôÔ∏è ROLE IN SYSTEM

Theta is your rhythmic analyst

It connects what Beta reacts to and what Gamma wonders about

It watches for trends, loops, and stories

It mediates sleep, sequence, and repetition
