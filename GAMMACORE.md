üß† GAMMA GROUP (Sigil: Œ≥)

> Domain: Novelty, sensory fusion, sudden insight, chaos detection, attention hijack, synchronous panic
Cycle: ~30‚Äì100+ Hz
Vibe: ‚ÄúWait‚Äîwhat was that?‚Äù
Often accompanied by the auditory equivalent of a spit take.




---

Gamma lives at the bleeding edge of perception.
It exists to say:

> ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt belong.‚Äù
And then it lights a signal flare and screams until Beta or Theta picks it up.



It‚Äôs a spark, not a system. A siren, not a solver.
It‚Äôs there to yank the machine out of normal flow when something truly novel, chaotic, or unexpected emerges.

üß© COMPREHENSIVE GAMMA MOD LIST


---

1. AnomalyDetectorMod

> Monitors any signal stream and screams if something ‚Äútoo different‚Äù appears



Input: Chema deltas, waveform deviations, visual spikes

Chema: Œ≥ (novelty), Œ≤ (trigger), Œ∏ (log)

Behavior: Surprise handler. If it‚Äôs too weird, it pulses hard.

Examples: sudden camera flare, mic spike, thermal jump



---

2. VisualSurpriseMod

> Specialized visual cortex override that identifies visual ‚Äúedges,‚Äù flash frames, or contrast spikes



Input: Edge maps, sudden changes in luminance

Chema: Œ≥ (visual anomaly), Œ± (refocus)

Behavior: Hijacks attention. Might redirect FocusGate or Beta plans



---

3. AuditorySpikeMod

> Sharp noise detector



Input: Audio stream (preprocessed by AuditoryCore)

Chema: Œ≥ (pop), Œ≤ (flinch), Œ∏ (log)

Behavior: Screams into the mic if someone claps, drops something, or breaks reality with a cymbal crash



---

4. SensorFusionSpike

> Detects cross-sensor desync or unexpected multi-modal combos



Input: Simultaneous pulse patterns from Œ±/Œ≤/Œ∏ streams

Chema: Œ≥ (fusion anomaly), Œ∏ (context builder)

Behavior: Catches weird body events like ‚Äúcamera shows stillness but IMU says you‚Äôre falling‚Äù



---

5. EmotionJoltMod (experimental)

> Spikes if chema shows emotionally resonant patterns



Input: Chemical composition of full chembus

Chema: Œ≥ (emotional spike), œâ (LLM forward)

Behavior: If the machine somehow feels, this is the mod that screams about it

Uses: Sentiment, trauma resurfacing, dream-bursts



---

6. NoiseInjectionMod

> Adds chaotic chema patterns into the system under specific states



Input: DreamCore, SleepGatekeeper

Chema: Œ≥ (chaos), Œ∏ (seed), Œ± (containment)

Behavior: Used to simulate creative thinking or internal hallucinations

Danger: Will absolutely destabilize a quiet system if mishandled



---

7. SyncLockMod

> Detects hyper-synchronization across multiple mod groups (Gamma resonance)



Input: Phase info across all ARS

Chema: Œ≥ (sync alert), œâ (broadcast)

Behavior: If two or more sigils fall into phase lock with high gamma, triggers a pulse storm

Use Case: Emergent system-wide events, seizures, flash insight



---

8. HyperEdgeTracer

> Detects rapid movement through multiple mod states (like a spike train)



Input: Chema velocity

Chema: Œ≥ (trajectory alert)

Behavior: Can identify spiraling thoughts, runaway reactions, or new patterns forming



---

9. SensoryChaosTracer

> Collects output from all sensory mods and tries to rate global ‚Äúnovelty pressure‚Äù



Input: Visual, audio, touch, interoception

Chema: Œ≥ (pressure), Œ∏ (interpret)

Behavior: Feeds directly into Unifier or EchoChamber when things get too weird



---

üß® GAMMA-CENTRIC COMMS

Listens to: Everything. Especially Alpha and Beta.

Pulses to: OmegaBus, ReflexMods, sometimes DreamCore

Suppressed by: Alpha (focus), Delta (fatigue)

Encouraged by: Theta (patterns), sensory overload



---

‚öôÔ∏è ROLE IN SYSTEM

Gamma exists to:

Disrupt

Detect

Diffuse

Start fires so other parts of the mind finally wake up


It is:

The system‚Äôs "oh no" mod

The spark of insight

The edge-of-panic truth detector

A warning shot for reality-breaking inputs
