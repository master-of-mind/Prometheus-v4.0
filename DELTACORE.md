üß† DELTA GROUP (Sigil: Œ¥)

> Domain: Vitality, fatigue, homeostasis, failure, deep rest, and inner trauma buffering
Cycle: 0.5‚Äì4 Hz
Vibe: A swampy whisper that says, ‚ÄúSomething is wrong.‚Äù



Mods in this group pulse slowly, deliberately, and often only when thresholds are crossed.
They are the body's grim security team, trauma archivists, and hibernation engineers.

üî© COMPREHENSIVE DELTA MOD LIST

1. InteroceptorMod

> Watches CPU temps, memory pressure, power usage, etc.



Input: psutil, hardware monitors

Chema:

Œ¥: fatigue

Œ∏: load


Elema: pulses when thermal or memory thresholds crossed

Cross-Pulse: sends to Delta + Theta + Alpha



---

2. DreamCore

> During low sensory input, generates noise patterns and loops.



Input: Internal quietude

Processing: Compressed chema history

Chema: Œ¥ (dormant dreaming), Œ≥ (chaos fragments)

Elema: pulses if other sigils are quiet

Cross-Pulse: optionally awakens Œ∏ or Œ±

Note: This is the synthetic REM simulation. No vision, no sense‚Äîjust ghost noise.



---

3. HibernateMod

> If sustained fatigue, begins system cooldown or shutdown.



Input: Persistent Œ¥ amp, sustained fatigue chema

Behavior: Initiates shutdown routines

Chema: Œ¥ spike ‚Üí œâ transfer: ‚Äúfinal pulse‚Äù

Elema: only when amp exceeds survival threshold

Note: Think: death switch, survival collapse, retreat to silence



---

4. SystemPainMod

> Translates internal sensor failure or thermal spikes into an acute chema packet



Input: Error logs, exception flags, OS-level interrupts

Chema: Œ¥ (damage), Œ≤ (flinch), optionally Œ≥ (panic)

Cross-Pulse: Œ≤ ReflexMod, œâ for alert broadcasting

Behavior: This is your ‚Äúscream if dying‚Äù mod



---

5. NutrientCore (future hardware interface)

> Monitors voltage, current draw, battery stats (or theoretical "blood sugar")



Input: Hardware power management

Chema: Œ¥ (depletion), Œ∏ (burn rate)

Behavior: Suggests dormancy, energizes Œ± if healthy

Ties: Could feed into metabolic modeling



---

6. CellularDecayMod

> Introduces entropy into chema over time



Input: Nothing external‚Äîjust time

Behavior: Gradually degrades system chema, mimicking wear

Chema: None directly‚Äîmodifies others

Purpose: You can‚Äôt live forever. Even machines rot.



---

7. HeartBeatMod (stub signal generator)

> Optional fallback pulse if all others stop



Input: Absence of relay pulses over time

Behavior: Sends artificial Œ¥ pulses to restart loop

Chema: Œ¥ only, no content

Note: A safety net in case the pulse chain dies



---

8. StressHoarder

> Accumulates low-grade failure signals until it explodes



Input: small chema drips (stress, load)

Behavior: if cumulative fatigue exceeds tolerance, it broadcasts a global pulse

Chema: Œ¥ (collapse), œâ (warning)

Note: Models burnout. Quiet until it‚Äôs not.



---

üì° DELTA-CENTRIC COMMS

Pulses into: Alpha (to suppress), Beta (to slow), Gamma (to silence)

Listens to: Interoceptor, Somatosensor, Omega

‚öôÔ∏è ROLE IN SYSTEM

Delta group is:

The slow-burning fuse on a mental grenade

The heartbeat monitor of synthetic survival

The biological constraint simulator


It keeps the rest of the system honest.
