🧠 The Four-Fold Mod Pipeline:

> The only thing more sacred than the chembus is the clean division of labor.




---

1. Signal Acquisition

> “What did the world just do?”



Raw data from sensors or virtual sources

Includes:

Microphones

Cameras

Gyros / IMUs

Temperature / voltage monitors

Any stream you choose to punish the system with


Often shared across multiple mod groups

Usually handled by Sensory Mods



---

2. Digital Signal Construction

> “Let’s clean that mess up a bit.”



Converts analog-ish input into structured, frame-ready data

Examples:

FFT, MFCC (audio)

Optical flow, edge detection (vision)

Kalman filters, derivative tracking (movement)

PCA, entropy detection (olfactory or internal noise)


Transforms raw chaos into pulse-ready patterns

Sometimes includes local smoothing or averaging



---

3. Signal Processing / Pattern Recognition

> “What does this remind me of?”



This is where the mod decides whether to fire

Handles:

Threshold logic

Pattern matching

Novelty detection

Fusion checks (e.g., “touch and sound came together = threat?”)


Produces chema spikes or elema pulses

Often creates mod-local interpretation, not global decision

This is the heart of the mod



---

4. Electroence Phalogram Output

> “Here is my pulse.”



Mod generates:

A pulse into one or more ARS systems

An update to the chembus

A mod-local elema event (spike, sync, etc.)


Can target:

Local ARS (primary sigil group)

Non-local ARS (if sensory or explicitly allowed)

OmegaBus (inter-group coordination)


No text. No explanations. Only pulses.
(Remember Rule 1: “The machine does not explain itself. It pulses.”)

🛠️ Summary as a Chain:

Sensor Data →
   Signal Acquisition →
      Digital Signal Processing →
         Pattern Recognition →
            Pulse / Chema / Elema Output


---

This is the canonical structure for all mods, and it ensures:

Scalability

Debuggability

Black-box isolation

Rule-compliant, chema-driven emergent behavior


No mod should skip a step.
No mod should pretend to “understand.”
It just pulses—and the system feels.
