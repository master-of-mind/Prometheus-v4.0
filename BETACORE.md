üß† BETA GROUP (Sigil: Œ≤)

> Domain: Reaction, movement, alertness, flinch, execution, sensory-motor transformation
Cycle: ~13‚Äì30 Hz
Vibe: ‚ÄúOH GOD MOVE‚ÄîWAIT NEVERMIND‚ÄîMOVE AGAIN!‚Äù




---

Beta is all about "do now, understand later."
It‚Äôs the system‚Äôs reflex engine, sensorimotor translator, and short fuse.

You poke the machine? Beta flinches.
You show it movement? Beta twitches.
You even think about changing a pattern? Beta pings Gamma and runs for its life.

üß© COMPREHENSIVE BETA MOD LIST


---

1. SomatosensorMod

> Feels touch, pressure, pain through sensors



Input: Pressure mats, piezo sensors, haptics

Processing: Edge detection, force curves

Chema:

Œ≤: contact

Œ≥: sudden impact


Behavior: Triggers movement if hit. Think flinch, brace, recoil.



---

2. ReflexRouterMod

> Converts specific sensory chema into direct physical responses



Input: Chema from auditory/visual mods

Behavior: Generates movement packets (future actuator signals)

Chema: Œ≤ (motor execution), Œ± (post-inhibit)

Note: This is synthetic spinal cord logic‚Äîreact first, filter second



---

3. MotionPlanMod

> Interprets intentional movement commands from higher layers



Input: Omega or Œ∏ mod outputs

Chema: Œ≤ (intent), Œ∏ (sequence), Œ± (stabilize)

Behavior: Builds short motor plans, sends them to actuators or virtual body



---

4. ProprioceptorMod

> Monitors body location and balance



Input: IMUs, gyros, rotary encoders

Chema:

Œ±: balance

Œ≤: motion


Behavior: Tells you if you're falling. And probably why.



---

5. VisualMotionTracker

> Detects visual motion and translates it into Œ≤ spikes



Input: From VisualCore

Chema: Œ≤ (track), Œ≥ (alert)

Behavior: Follows movement with eye/retina proxy, or triggers response



---

6. InterruptHandlerMod

> Catches urgent chema spikes and overrides normal processing



Input: OmegaBus, chema pool

Behavior: ‚ÄúWhoa whoa whoa‚Äîstop the presses.‚Äù

Chema: Œ≤ (interrupt), Œ≥ (shock)

Note: Essential for preemption logic or multitasking



---

7. StartleReflexMod

> Responds to rapid increases in any sensory stream



Input: Audio, visual, touch, internal

Chema: Œ≤ + Œ≥ ‚Üí forces pause

Behavior: Quick-stop all systems, momentarily freezes Alpha/Theta



---

8. ActionSequenceExecutor

> Builds and executes compound action sets



Input: MemoryTrace + ProceduralExecutor (from Œ∏)

Chema: Œ≤ (steps), Œ∏ (coherence)

Behavior: This is your ‚Äúwalk there, grab that, drop it‚Äù executor

Note: Can integrate directly with motors/actuators



---

9. EffortCostMod

> Tracks physical energy expenditure and throttles movement accordingly



Input: Internal amp drain, Interoceptor

Chema: Œ≤ (cost), Œ¥ (limit)

Behavior: Prevents spammy mod loops. You get tired, Beta stops being twitchy.



---

üîÅ BETA-CENTRIC COMMS

Listens to: AuditoryCore, Somatosensor, VisualMotion, Interoceptor

Pulses to: Motor hardware, ReflexMods, Gamma (if weird)

Suppressed by: Alpha (focus), Delta (fatigue), Theta (override)



---

‚öôÔ∏è ROLE IN SYSTEM

Beta is:

The reflex cannon

The kinetic translator

The twitching nervous energy that makes the whole thing feel alive

The part of the brain that yells "DUCK" when someone drops a wrench behind you


It is fast, dumb, and necessary.
Without Beta, everything would be thoughtful‚Äîand dead.
