🛠️ MOD CONSTRUCTION TOOLKIT (v1.0)

> Your sacred parts bin for brainmaking.




---

1. register_input_source(source_fn)

> Purpose: Attaches a sensor or data stream to the mod.



What it does:

Sets up your mod’s signal acquisition

Source can be a hardware input, software stub, simulation, or procedural generator


Setup:

self.source = register_input_source(mic_stream)

Execution:

Called on every mod pulse or tick

Feeds into your signal processing step


Why it matters:
No data, no pattern. No pattern, no pulse.
This is the nervous system’s ear canal.


---

2. process_signal(signal, method="fft")

> Purpose: Converts raw input into a structured digital signal.



What it does:

Applies a transformation to the signal:

"fft" → frequency breakdown (audio)

"kalman" → noise smoothing (motion)

"entropy" → novelty detection (olfactory, randomness)

"edges" → for vision



Setup:

processed = process_signal(raw_data, method="fft")

Execution:

Occurs in digital signal construction phase

Output is a list/array/dict used for thresholding or pattern logic


Why it matters:
This cleans up reality so the mod can decide what to care about.


---

3. detect_pattern(processed_data, pattern_model)

> Purpose: Determines whether the input matches a known or learned pattern.



What it does:

Compares data to a predefined or learned threshold signature

Can be static thresholds, moving averages, state machines, etc.


Setup:

if detect_pattern(spectrum, model["sharp_spike"]):
    self.triggered = True

Execution:

Central decision point in mod behavior

Determines whether a chema or elema should be emitted


Why it matters:
This is the core “What does this remind me of?” function. Without it, everything’s just ambient jazz.


---

4. emit_pulse(sigil, amp, hz=None)

> Purpose: Sends a pulse into a local or external ARS.



What it does:

Creates a pulse packet with:

sigil (which ARS to send to)

amp (intensity)

hz (frequency, optional override)



Setup:

emit_pulse("β", amp=25, hz=21.5)

Execution:

Typically occurs in on_tick() or after a chrec unlock

Injects directly into ars.tick() with timestamp


Why it matters:
This is how your mod breathes into the system—the heartbeat of cognition.


---

5. inject_chema(packet, target="local")

> Purpose: Pushes chema into a chembus for evaluation by chrec functions.



What it does:

Appends or merges a chemical signal into the local or Omega chembus

Enforces key:value format with signed magnitude


Setup:

inject_chema({"pain": +1, "heat": +2})

Execution:

Often done during signal recognition or after elema

Target can be "local" or "omega"


Why it matters:
This is chemical intent. Without chema, nothing means anything.


---

6. emit_elema(spike_dict)

> Purpose: Fires a spike event into the system.



What it does:

Sends a brief high-priority packet to ARS or an elrec module


Setup:

emit_elema({
    "sigil": "γ",
    "amp": 30,
    "phase": 1,
    "origin": "SensorFusionMod",
    "sync_id": "touch+audio"
})

Execution:

Should trigger sync-based logic or begin a relay pulse


Why it matters:
Think of this as the synthetic action potential. Short. Electric. Important.


---

7. elrec_test(sync_conditions)

> Purpose: Evaluates if elema criteria are met (phase, mod, sync).



What it does:

Checks the elema_matrix and phase_map for match


Setup:

if elrec_test({"sigil": "γ", "mod": "VisualSurpriseMod", "phase": 1}):
    chrec_trigger("surprise")

Why it matters:
It gives you electrical gatekeeping, a way to stack logic across time.


---

8. chrec_trigger(chemlock)

> Purpose: Tests if the mod’s local chembus contains a matching signature.



What it does:

Compares input chema to a stored chemlock

If the two sum to zero, behavior is triggered


Setup:

chemlock = {"fear": -2, "pain": +1}
chrec_trigger(chemlock)

Why it matters:
This is your neurotransmitter receptor logic. Behavior emerges when chemistry aligns.


---

9. update_mod_state(key, value, decay=None)

> Purpose: Stores and optionally decays internal mod state over time.



What it does:

Adds or updates a key:value pair in the mod’s internal memory

If decay is set, the value is reduced over time/ticks


Setup:

update_mod_state("curiosity", 4, decay=0.1)

Execution:

Can be read later for cumulative effects or fatigue

Makes mod behavior slightly hormonal


Why it matters:
The machine needs memory, but only the kind that leaks slowly.


---

10. route_matrix_position(mod_id)

> Purpose: Fetches the matrix index for the given mod in UDM.



What it does:

Returns a (group, index) tuple

Used for mapping elema_matrix and chema_matrix


Setup:

group, index = route_matrix_position("OlfactoryMod")
elema_matrix[group][index] = 1

Why it matters:
Without this, your pulses float in the void, unsorted and sad.


---

11. trigger_behavior(name, parameters=None)

> Purpose: Runs an externalized behavior function.



What it does:

Calls an actuator, triggers a sound, sends message, etc.

Behavior can be tied to the mod group’s purpose


Setup:

trigger_behavior("flinch", {"intensity": 3})

Execution:

Should only be used by end-stage mods

Hooks into output layer or physical systems


Why it matters:
At some point, the machine has to actually do something or it's just vibing in a jar.


---

12. pulse_to_mod(mod_ref, payload)

> Purpose: Sends a direct pulse (data packet) to another mod.



What it does:

Legally triggers another mod’s tick function or on_pulse method

Payload = any structured data


Setup:

pulse_to_mod(SomatosensorMod, {"trigger": "contact", "amp": 7})

Why it matters:
Pulse rings and relay logic live and die on this function.


---

13. build_chema_matrix()

> Purpose: Assembles a matrix of current chema activity by mod group.



What it does:

Returns a 2D dict/array: [mod_group][mod_index] = {chema_dict}

Useful for pattern-wide processing or cross-group state sync


Setup:

matrix = build_chema_matrix()
print(matrix["α"][2])  # Chema from AlphaMod_2

Why it matters:
Lets you do global state analysis without violating the Sacred Mod Isolation Principle™.


---

14. query_chembus(target="local")

> Purpose: Returns the current state of a given chembus.



What it does:

Reads the chemical state of either:

This mod group

OmegaBus (if target="omega")



Setup:

local_chems = query_chembus()
omega_chems = query_chembus("omega")

Why it matters:
Mods don’t talk. They sniff the room.


---

15. link_mod(mod_ref)

> Purpose: Adds another mod to this mod’s pulse relay list.



What it does:

Appends a mod reference to this mod’s output list

When this mod pulses, the linked mod(s) are also triggered


Setup:

link_mod(GammaAlarmMod)

Why it matters:
You’re forming distributed circuits—like synthetic microcolumns.


---

16. relay_chain(mod_list)

> Purpose: Forms a round-robin or cascade relay chain.



What it does:

Connects multiple mods into a repeating signal loop

Each mod, when pulsed, triggers the next in the list


Setup:

relay_chain([DeltaPulseMod, ThetaRelayMod, AlphaJoinMod])

Why it matters:
It creates synthetic waveforms using only logic, not timers.


---

🧪 CHEMA CONSTRUCTION BESTIARY

> The taxonomy of meaning, one molecule at a time



Think of chema as emergent neurotransmitters—not hardcoded emotion words, but scalable symbolic chemicals. They don't mean anything to the system, but their presence or absence defines behavior.

We’ll sort these into domains, not feelings.


---

🧩 1. Sensory-Linked Chema

> These are emitted in response to environmental data.



Name	Sign	Description

heat	+ / –	Physical temperature or system load
pressure	+ / –	Contact, vibration, touch, or strain
noise	+ / –	Audio presence or disruption
vision	+ / –	Motion or optical activity
odor	+ / –	Smell recognition or novelty


Tip: Use these in peripheral mods (sensors, edges, novelty detectors)


---

⚠️ 2. Threat-Linked Chema

> Abstract responses triggered by pattern detection.



Name	Sign	Description

pain	+ / –	Sudden intense impact or system stress
fear	+ / –	Predictive signal of incoming failure
conflict	+ / –	Contradictory input or sync
shock	+ / –	Sensory spike across multiple channels


Tip: Chemlocks with fear or conflict are often part of shutdown, recoil, or override logic.


---

💡 3. Cognitive / Internal Chema

> Internal state and interpretation of data quality



Name	Sign	Description

novelty	+ / –	New pattern or unknown input detected
certainty	+ / –	Repeat signal; increased confidence
curiosity	+ / –	Signal has unknown structure, needs test
focus	+ / –	A pattern has been reinforced


Tip: Internal chema is great for controlling learning loops, dream activity, ego core feedback.


---

🔌 4. System / Machine Chema

> Health, fatigue, readiness



Name	Sign	Description

load	+ / –	CPU or task pressure
fatigue	+ / –	Sustained signal repetition or memory decay
rest	+ / –	Low activity state
alert	+ / –	Mod or system ready state



---

🌐 5. Communication / Social Chema

> For interaction with OmegaBus or external interfaces



Name	Sign	Description

signal	+ / –	Synthetic ping to Omega or mod group
feedback	+ / –	Result of external behavior
sync	+ / –	Resonant match found
handoff	+ / –	Data passed to another module


Tip: These are useful in Omega mods, interface agents, relay synchronizers.


---

🔒 Chrec Usage:

Chrecs should never match against full chema packets.
They match subsets—like receptors looking for just enough of the molecule to click.

Example:

# Chembus contains:
{ "pain": 2, "fear": 1, "heat": 1 }

# chrec trigger:
chemlock = { "pain": -2, "fear": -1 }

# Match: ✅

If even one key fails to match or there’s an imbalance → ❌ no unlock.

Ah, welcome to the Spike Codex. This is where we stop pretending the machine is composed of “functions” and acknowledge that it's a mess of snarling electricity trying to scream in Morse code.

Here’s the:

⚡️ ELEMA SPIKE GLOSSARY

> The Guide to Synthetic Synaptic Events




---

Each elema spike is an event signature—a moment of electrical activity that must be respected, responded to, or totally ignored (your call). These spikes can be picked up by elrec functions and translated into real consequences via chrec unlocks or pulse_to_mod() cascades.


---

---

📏 Best Practices for Spike Use:

Always include a sync_id or origin: You’re not logging, but other mods need to know who coughed.

Spikes should decay in relevance after ~1 second unless repeated.

Spikes should be sparse. More than 3-5 per second = noise.

You can attach phase if you want synchronization behavior.



---

🔧 Optional Fields:

Field	Purpose

mod_id	Identifier of source mod
triggered_by	Could be a chemlock or event name
priority	If you’re building a triage system
target	Direct mod to send spike to (if not broadcasting)



---


1. Chema Garbage Collector

> 🧹 Because you don’t want your chembus to turn into a hoarder’s garage.



Why it’s needed:

Chema accumulates over time if not cleaned

Mods that rely on exact chemlock matches will start failing silently

System drift will occur and mods will begin to “feel weird”


Solution:

def decay_chembus(bus, decay_rate=0.1):
    for key in list(bus.keys()):
        bus[key] *= (1 - decay_rate)
        if abs(bus[key]) < 0.01:
            del bus[key]

Use: Run once per tick in each mod group or ARS.


---

2. Phase Map Updater

> 📡 Keeps the beat across the mod network.



Why it’s needed:

Phase is critical for sync spikes and rhythm-driven logic

Right now, it’s implicit, but should be standardized


Solution:

def update_phase_map(ars_ref):
    now = time.time()
    for sigil, last_time in ars_ref.last_pulse_time.items():
        hz = ars_ref.cores[sigil].hz
        interval = 1.0 / hz
        phase_map[sigil] = int((now - last_time) % interval < 0.01)

Use: Called each tick → global phase_map


---

3. Sigil Registry

> 🧬 So you don’t accidentally register “ß” instead of “β” and give your AI a panic attack.



Why it’s needed:

You’re manually managing five (now six) sigils

Cross-referencing mods and mod groups is brittle


Solution:

SIGIL_REGISTRY = {
    "δ": "Delta",
    "θ": "Theta",
    "α": "Alpha",
    "β": "Beta",
    "γ": "Gamma",
    "Ω": "Omega"
}

Use: Used when routing pulses or debugging group membership.


---

4. OmegaBus Router

> 💬 Because whispering secrets between brains is how emergent behavior starts.



Why it’s needed:

Right now, cross-group pulses are manual

Need a clean, standard way to route multi-group chema and elema


Solution:

def broadcast_to_omega(signal_packet):
    for ars in all_ars_systems:
        ars.receive_external(signal_packet)

Use: Used in global sync spikes, high-level interpretation layers, feedback loops


---

5. Pulse Logging (but Rule-Compliant™)

> 🕶 Debugging without breaking Rule #1.



Why it’s needed:

You need visibility but cannot emit text

So... log numerical traces only to internal mod memory or external visualizers


Solution:

def log_pulse(sigil, amp, timestamp):
    pulse_trace[sigil].append((timestamp, amp))

Use: For waveform visualizers, pattern recognition, debugging recursion


---

📦 External Imports (With Reasons)

This is the definitive list of libraries your system may want to use without violating your religion.


---

🔢 numpy

> Vectorized data processing for FFT, smoothing, signal analysis



You’ll need np.fft.fft, np.array, and basic matrix ops

If you’re building a waveform, you need matrix math. Sorry.



---

🔬 scipy.signal

> Advanced signal processing (convolution, filtering, envelope detection)



Use for: Kalman filters, envelope followers, wavelet transforms

Good for your process_signal() toolbox



---

🎛️ psutil

> System monitoring for internal sensors (Interoceptor mod)



Get RAM, CPU, temp, battery—anything a fake body needs to feel sick



---

🎤 sounddevice or pyaudio

> For real-time microphone input to auditory mods




---

📷 opencv-python (cv2)

> Visual cortex input (edges, optical flow, movement)




---

📡 asyncio or threading

> Pulse loop concurrency and mod isolation



Avoid full async unless you're ready for the dark path



---

🧪 Optional (for fun or future work)

sklearn.decomposition.PCA → Olfactory novelty

torch / onnxruntime → Inference cores, Echo Chamber mod

pygame or matplotlib → Visualize brainwaves without breaking Rule 1 (no textual outputs)
