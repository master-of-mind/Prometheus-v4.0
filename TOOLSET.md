🛠️ MOD CONSTRUCTION TOOLKIT (v1.0)

> Your sacred parts bin for brainmaking.




---

1. register_input_source(source_fn)

> Purpose: Attaches a sensor or data stream to the mod.



What it does:

Sets up your mod’s signal acquisition

Source can be a hardware input, software stub, simulation, or procedural generator


Setup:

self.source = register_input_source(mic_stream)

Execution:

Called on every mod pulse or tick

Feeds into your signal processing step


Why it matters:
No data, no pattern. No pattern, no pulse.
This is the nervous system’s ear canal.


---

2. process_signal(signal, method="fft")

> Purpose: Converts raw input into a structured digital signal.



What it does:

Applies a transformation to the signal:

"fft" → frequency breakdown (audio)

"kalman" → noise smoothing (motion)

"entropy" → novelty detection (olfactory, randomness)

"edges" → for vision



Setup:

processed = process_signal(raw_data, method="fft")

Execution:

Occurs in digital signal construction phase

Output is a list/array/dict used for thresholding or pattern logic


Why it matters:
This cleans up reality so the mod can decide what to care about.


---

3. detect_pattern(processed_data, pattern_model)

> Purpose: Determines whether the input matches a known or learned pattern.



What it does:

Compares data to a predefined or learned threshold signature

Can be static thresholds, moving averages, state machines, etc.


Setup:

if detect_pattern(spectrum, model["sharp_spike"]):
    self.triggered = True

Execution:

Central decision point in mod behavior

Determines whether a chema or elema should be emitted


Why it matters:
This is the core “What does this remind me of?” function. Without it, everything’s just ambient jazz.


---

4. emit_pulse(sigil, amp, hz=None)

> Purpose: Sends a pulse into a local or external ARS.



What it does:

Creates a pulse packet with:

sigil (which ARS to send to)

amp (intensity)

hz (frequency, optional override)



Setup:

emit_pulse("β", amp=25, hz=21.5)

Execution:

Typically occurs in on_tick() or after a chrec unlock

Injects directly into ars.tick() with timestamp


Why it matters:
This is how your mod breathes into the system—the heartbeat of cognition.


---

5. inject_chema(packet, target="local")

> Purpose: Pushes chema into a chembus for evaluation by chrec functions.



What it does:

Appends or merges a chemical signal into the local or Omega chembus

Enforces key:value format with signed magnitude


Setup:

inject_chema({"pain": +1, "heat": +2})

Execution:

Often done during signal recognition or after elema

Target can be "local" or "omega"


Why it matters:
This is chemical intent. Without chema, nothing means anything.


---

6. emit_elema(spike_dict)

> Purpose: Fires a spike event into the system.



What it does:

Sends a brief high-priority packet to ARS or an elrec module


Setup:

emit_elema({
    "sigil": "γ",
    "amp": 30,
    "phase": 1,
    "origin": "SensorFusionMod",
    "sync_id": "touch+audio"
})

Execution:

Should trigger sync-based logic or begin a relay pulse


Why it matters:
Think of this as the synthetic action potential. Short. Electric. Important.


---

7. elrec_test(sync_conditions)

> Purpose: Evaluates if elema criteria are met (phase, mod, sync).



What it does:

Checks the elema_matrix and phase_map for match


Setup:

if elrec_test({"sigil": "γ", "mod": "VisualSurpriseMod", "phase": 1}):
    chrec_trigger("surprise")

Why it matters:
It gives you electrical gatekeeping, a way to stack logic across time.


---

8. chrec_trigger(chemlock)

> Purpose: Tests if the mod’s local chembus contains a matching signature.



What it does:

Compares input chema to a stored chemlock

If the two sum to zero, behavior is triggered


Setup:

chemlock = {"fear": -2, "pain": +1}
chrec_trigger(chemlock)

Why it matters:
This is your neurotransmitter receptor logic. Behavior emerges when chemistry aligns.
