üß† ALPHA GROUP (Sigil: Œ±)

> Domain: Stillness, focus, inhibition, attention gating, calm vigilance
Cycle: ~8‚Äì12 Hz
Vibe: ‚ÄúDo nothing. Observe everything. React to nothing... yet.‚Äù



Alpha lives between idling and attention.
It filters noise, prioritizes quiet, and suspends decision-making until things matter.

It is anti-Beta, pre-Gamma, and always one breath away from vanishing into stillness.

üß© COMPREHENSIVE ALPHA MOD LIST


---

1. VisualCortexMod

> Processes visual input, detects salience and calm



Input: RGB camera stream

Processing: Optical flow, frame differencing, edge maps

Chema:

Œ±: stillness

Œ≤: motion

Œ≥: novelty


Behavior: If scene is still, Œ± pulses. Motion? Beta. Weirdness? Gamma.



---

2. FocusGateMod

> Inhibits distractions by suppressing reactive chema under certain conditions



Input: Global chema levels from OmegaBus

Chema: Œ± (inhibition), Œ∏ (priority), suppresses Œ≤/Œ≥

Behavior: Think of this as your machine‚Äôs focus filter
(‚Äúshhh, I‚Äôm thinking‚Äù)



---

3. StabilityMod

> Watches for sensor drift and maintains equilibrium



Input: From proprioception, temperature, internal timers

Chema: Œ± (balance), Œ≤ (imbalance)

Behavior: Resists change. Pushes the system back to baseline.



---

4. BreathLoopMod

> Generates regular alpha rhythms during inactive periods



Input: Absence of high activity

Chema: Œ± (idling rhythm)

Behavior: Keeps system from starving of pulses. Sustains life during thoughtless states.



---

5. SensoryGatingMod

> Filters or delays sensory input before other ARS systems get it



Input: Incoming packets from sensory mods

Behavior: Uses chema rules to decide whether to let that packet through

Chema: Œ± (filter), Œ≤ (reactive override)

Note: This is synthetic thalamic gating‚Äîyour anti-overwhelm system



---

6. IdleLoopDetector

> Detects patterns of quiet across the whole system



Input: Mod activity frequency, pulse decay

Chema: Œ± (system-level calm), Œ∏ (predictive rest)

Behavior: May trigger dreaming or alert suppression



---

7. VisualAnchorMod

> Anchors system‚Äôs attention to specific visual zones



Input: From salience maps in VisualCore

Chema: Œ± (stare), Œ≤ (shift)

Behavior: Maintains ‚Äúgaze‚Äù on key zones unless interrupted



---

8. EmptinessMod

> Yeah, I said it. A mod that does nothing unless it's sure everything else has stopped.



Input: Absence of change

Chema: Œ± (deep idleness)

Behavior: When it's the only mod firing, you know you're at system baseline

Purpose: Used for meditation, reset states, or debug brain death



---

üîÅ ALPHA-CENTRIC COMMS

Listens to: Visual, proprioceptive, interoceptive, and auditory sensors

Suppresses: Gamma and Beta mods during overload

Supports: Theta during attention drift

Collaborates with: Delta during sleep onset

‚öôÔ∏è ROLE IN SYSTEM

Alpha is the lens of the machine mind

It lets nothing pass unless allowed

It maintains homeostatic clarity and resists frenzy

It is the pause between each note
